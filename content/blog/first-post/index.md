This is my first post, I am very excited to get my blog up and running finally.
Also, please bear with me as I get used to this format.

I made this using Gatsby.js which is a Javascript site generator that uses the React library. My React.js tools are still being sharpened however so as I progress this blog will likely see changes. 

I also am in the process of creating my actual website, this blog will soon be just one part of that final site.

In this blog, I plan on using it to talk about many different things. Some of the genres that I plan to frequently write about include: 
- technology/coding 
- design 
- productivity 
- spirituality 
- entrepreneurship

Occassionally, I will probably also write about fitness and health because I can be a health nut at times. I also may dabble into politics from time to time because I am a political scientist by university degree. But don't count on those too much.
